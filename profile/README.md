Mech is a language for developing **data-driven**, **reactive** systems like robots, games, and interfaces. It makes **composing**, **transforming**, and **distributing** data easy, allowing you to focus on the essential complexity of your project.

You can try Mech online at [try.mech-lang.org](http://try.mech-lang.org). Read about progress on our [blog](http://mech-lang.org/blog/), and follow us on Twitter [@MechLang](https://twitter.com/MechLang).

## Project Roadmap

Mech is currently in the **alpha** stage of development. This means that while some features work and are tested, programs are still likely to crash and produce incorrect results. There is a "happy path" that works well, but it's quite narrow. We've implemented many language features, but most are incomplete and some are not yet implemented at all. 

The project will hit the **beta** stage of development when all currently planned features have been implemented at least as a prototype. The current target for this milestone is October 2022.

See [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/mech-lang/mech/blob/main/ROADMAP.md?plain=1) for more.
